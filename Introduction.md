# Welcome to my page!

Hello, i'm Nathan and i'am student from Brazil with 16 yrs. Please, accomodate yourself here and we can discuss further.

## Who is Nathan?

Well, introducing myself is a bit of a hit but in a simple way i'm trying to expand my programming apprendice on GitHub to get well on this new world of programming language. 
As well i'm a fan of the Fallout Franchise so expect that many things on this page will have some Fallout conotations like the Enclave, Vaults etcetera.
